Abstract

   In today's complex network environment, the unified management of
   multi-vendor network devices faces numerous challenges, such as
   diverse models and complex configurations.  Traditional network
   management protocols like Netconf and Restconf are difficult to
   standardize during the management process, resulting in low
   efficiency.  MCP (Model Context Protocol) technology, combined with
   LLM technology, brings new ideas and solutions for the batch
   management of multi-vendor network devices, and is expected to
   significantly improve the efficiency and flexibility of network
   management.
