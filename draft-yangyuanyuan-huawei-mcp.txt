1.  Introduction

   With the emergence of various LLM models, enterprises face different
   frameworks and systems during deployment, such as ChatGPT's plugin
   mechanism and agent frameworks.  Adapting to these mechanisms
   requires developing distinct toolchains, which increases development
   costs.  Additionally, LLMs rely on contextual data, but various
   agents retrieve local and remote data in a fragmented manner, lacking
   a unified management approach.

   The Model Control Protocol (MCP) provides a standardized framework
   for intent-based network automation in multi-vendor environments,
   specifically addressing the interoperability challenges between large
   language models (LLMs) and heterogeneous network equipment.  By
   establishing vendor-neutral interfaces for tool encapsulation, intent
   translation, and closed-loop execution, MCP enables:

   *  Unified operation abstraction through normalized MCP tool
      definitions

   *  Seamless LLM integration via structured API contracts

   *  Closed-Loop Automation Execution

   Further, this document specifies MCP's architecture and operational
   workflows for network automation scenarios, with particular focus on:

   *  The end-to-end processing chain from natural language input to
      device configuration

   *  Protocol translation requirements between AI systems and network
      elements

   *  Comparative analysis of on-premises versus cloud-hosted deployment
      models

2.  Terminology & Notation Conventions

   The following terms are used throughout this document:

2.1.  MCP

   *  *Host*: The entity initiating the LLM request

   *  *Client*: A built-in module within a host, specifically designed
      for interaction with the MCP server.

   *  *CLI*: Command Line Interface

   *  *MCP Server*: A dedicated server that interacts with MCP clients
      and provides MCP services.

   *  *MCP protocol*: The whole MCP framework

2.2.  Others

   *  *LLM*: Large Language Model

   *  *Netconf*: Network Configuration Protocol

   *  *Restconf*: RESTful Network Configuration Protocol

   *  *SNMP*: Simple Network Management Protocol

3.  Operation Need

   In the scenario of cross-vendor network equipment batch management, a
   large number of devices from different vendors need to be uniformly
   managed, which can lead to the following issues:

3.1.  Inconsistent YANG Model Support

   Different vendors implement different YANG models (standard or
   proprietary), leading to:

   *  Lack of uniform data structures for configuration/retrieval.

   *  Requirement for vendor-specific adaptations in automation scripts.

3.2.  Partial or Non-Standard RESTCONF/NETCONF Implementations

   Some vendors only partially support standard YANG models, and
   proprietary extensions may break interoperability.

3.3.  Performance & Scalability Issues

   When managing cross-vendor devices in bulk, NETCONF can be slower
   than RESTCONF (HTTP/HTTPS) for large-scale operations, while RESTCONF
   lacks native batching support.  Additionally, both protocols may
   suffer from timeouts when handling many devices simultaneously.

4.  Solution

   The LLM model, with its ability to comprehend diverse complex
   requirements and deliver corresponding functionalities, is well-
   suited for cross-vendor network equipment batch management,
   effectively addressing the aforementioned challenges.  Therefore, we
   have introduced the MCP protocol to standardize the management of
   different LLM models, serving as the foundation for building an
   intelligent network control platform.

   To be more specific, there are three parts:

4.1.  Encapsulating Device Operations into MCP Tools

   *  _Objective_: Standardize heterogeneous device operations into
      modular, reusable tools.

   *  _Implementation_:

      -  _Tool Abstraction_: Vendor-specific CLI/API commands are
         wrapped into discrete MCP Tools with uniform JSON/Protobuf
         schemas.

      -  _Tool Registry_: A centralized repository hosts MCP Tools with
         metadata (e.g., vendor compatibility, privilege requirements).

      -  _Dynamic Loading_: Servers (e.g., network controllers) invoke
         tools on demand via MCP RPCs, decoupling tool updates from core
         platform logic.

   *  _Benefits_:

      -  Eliminates manual translation of commands across vendors.

      -  Enables plug-and-play integration of new device types.

4.2.  LLM APIs for Intent-to-Tool Translation

   *  Objective: Bridge natural language instructions to executable tool
      sequences.

   *  Workflow:

      -  Intent Parsing: LLM APIs (e.g., GPT-4, Claude) process user
         queries like "Upgrade all switches in Datacenter A during
         maintenance" into structured intents.

      -  Toolchain Generation: The LLM selects and sequences MCP Tools
         (e.g., get_inventory → schedule_downtime → download_firmware →
         validate_upgrade).

      -  Validation: Pre-execution checks verify tool compatibility with
         target devices (e.g., ensuring upgrade_tool supports Arista EOS
         versions).

   *  APIs Exposed:

      -  mcp-translate: Converts text to toolchain JSON.

      -  mcp-validate: Confirms tool availability/permissions.

4.3.  Closed-Loop Automation Execution

   *  Objective: Achieve end-to-end automation from language input to
      network changes.

   *  Execution Flow:

      -  User Input: Operator submits request via chat/voice (e.g.,
         "Block TCP port 22 on all edge routers").

      -  LLM Processing:

         o  Intent → Toolchain: Identifies get_edge_routers +
            configure_acl tools.

         o  Parameter Binding: Maps "TCP port 22" to {"protocol": "tcp",
            "port": 22, "action": "deny"}.

      -  Orchestration: MCP Runtime schedules tools, handles
         dependencies (e.g., backup configs first), and enforces RBAC.

      -  Feedback: Real-time logs/rollback if configure_acl fails on any
         device.

   *  Key Features:

      -  Idempotency: Tools safely retry/rollback.

      -  Auditability: Full traceability of LLM decisions and tool
         executions.

5.  Deployment Plan

   During the deployment phase, there are three key aspects to consider:

   *  *Function-Specific MCP Servers*: Deploy dedicated MCP servers
      tailored to different functions and domains, such as network log
      analysis, device configuration management, energy consumption
      management, and security operations.

   *  *Secure and Scalable Architecture*: Implement stringent security
      measures to ensure only authorized AI models and users can access
      and control network resources via MCP.

   *  *Automated Workflows*: Leverage MCP to enable LLM-coordinated
      multi-tool automation, supporting real-time monitoring,
      diagnostics, and fault remediation.

   A general workflow is as follows:

   *  User Input Submission: An operator submits a natural language
      request (e.g., "Disable port 22 on all edge switches") to the LLM
      interface.

   *  LLM Intent Processing: The LLM parses the input, identifies the
      operational intent, and forwards a structured request to the local
      O&M Console for validation and logging.

   *  MCP Tool Discovery: The O&M Console routes the request to the MCP
      Client, which queries the MCP Server to retrieve the available
      tools.

   *  LLM Toolchain Decision:

      -  The LLM evaluates the context and if tools are required, select
         and sequence tools.

      -  The decision is sent back to the MCP Client and then MCP Client
         will execute tools via server.

   *  Protocol Translation & Execution: The MCP Server executes the
      translated commands on target devices and returns results to the
      client.

   *  Result Aggregation & Feedback: The MCP Client collates tool
      outputs (success/failure logs) and forwards them to the LLM for
      summarization.

   While the overall workflow remains consistent, the MCP Server's
   deployment location (on-premises or remote) introduces operational
   variations.  This section defines two refined approaches to
   accommodate differing deployment scenarios.

5.1.  MCP within Local NCE

   *  Scope: The MCP Server is hosted within the operator's local
      network, colocated with the O&M Console and MCP Client.

   *  Key Characteristics:

      -  Low Latency: Direct access to network devices minimizes tool
         execution delays.

      -  Data Control: All processing (LLM queries, tool executions)
         remains within the operator’s infrastructure.

5.1.1.  Use cases

   *  Air-Gapped Networks (Military/Critical Infrastructure)

      -  Scenario: A power grid control network prohibits external
         connectivity.

      -  Implementation:

         o  MCP Server runs on local servers with pre-loaded tool
            definitions.

         o  LLM operates offline (e.g., quantized model) or via approved
            internal APIs.

      -  Advantage: Ensures zero data exfiltration risks.

5.2.  MCP in Remote Device

   *  Scope: The MCP Server operates in a cloud environment, serving
      distributed MCP Clients via public/private APIs.

   *  Key Characteristics:

      -  Centralized Management: A single MCP Server instance can manage
         multiple geographically dispersed networks.

      -  Scalability: Cloud-native scaling accommodates dynamic tool
         registry updates and high request volumes.

5.2.1.  Use cases

   *  Global Enterprise Network Automation

      -  Scenario: A multinational corporation standardizes
         configurations across hundreds of branch offices.

      -  Implementation:

         o  MCP Server hosted on AWS/Azure with regional replicas.

         o  Tools like deploy_vpn_template adapt to local compliance
            rules.

      -  Advantage: Unified toolchain reduces configuration drift.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.

7.  Security Considerations

   This document analyzes the application of MCP in sophisticated batch
   network management and proposes two deployment schemes, which may
   introduce certain security risks.  Since MCP's internal instructions
   are invisible to users and only accessible to the LLM model,
   attackers could potentially inject malicious instructions, leading to
   information leakage or workflow errors.

   To address such security risks, measures like version locking
   mechanisms, enhanced visibility, and context isolation can provide a
   certain level of protection.

8.  Conclusion

   MCP Technology delivers an innovative solution for cross-vendor
   network device management at scale.  By enhancing and extending
   traditional network management protocols (NETCONF/RESTCONF), it
   effectively addresses multi-vendor device management challenges while
   significantly improving network administration efficiency and service
   quality.  As the technology matures, MCP is positioned for widespread
   adoption in network management domains.
