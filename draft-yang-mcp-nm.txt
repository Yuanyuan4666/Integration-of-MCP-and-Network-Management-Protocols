1.  Introduction

   The Model Context Protocol (MCP) provides a standardized way for LLMs
   to access and utilize information from different sources, interact
   with tools, making it easier to build AI applications that can
   interact with external LLM and network management systems.

   MCP has been seen as rapid adoption internet technology.  The
   application of MCP in the network management field is meant to
   develop various rich AI driven network applications, realize intent
   based networks management automation in the multi-vendor
   heterogeneous network environment.  By establishing standard
   interfaces for tool encapsulation, intent translation, and closed-
   loop execution within the network management system, MCP enables AI
   Agents to have:

   *  Unified operation abstraction through normalized MCP tool
      definitions

   *  Seamless LLM integration via the structured protocol

   *  Automation Execution Ability

   This document discusses the applicability of MCP to the network
   management plane in the IP network that utilizes IETF technologies.
   It explores operational aspect, key components, generic workflow and
   deployment scenarios.  The impact of integrating MCP into the network
   management system will also be discussed.

2.  Terminology & Notation Conventions

   The following terms are used throughout this document:

2.1.  MCP

   *  *MCP Protocol*: MCP is an open standard designed to facilitate
      communication between LLMs and external data sources or tools.

   *  *MCP Host*: The entity initiating the LLM request.

   *  *MCP Client*: A built-in module within a host, specifically
      designed for interaction with the MCP server.

   *  *MCP Server*: A dedicated server that interacts with MCP clients
      and provides tools.

   *  *CLI*: Command Line Interface

2.2.  Others

   *  *LLM*: Large Language Model

   *  *NETCONF*: Network Configuration Protocol [RFC6241]

   *  *RESTCONF*: RESTful Network Configuration Protocol [RFC8040]

   *  *SNMP*: A Simple Network Management Protocol [RFC2576]

3.  Overview of key challenges for the network management

   In large scale network management environment, a large number of
   devices from different vendors need to be uniformly managed, which
   can lead to the following issues or challenges:

3.1.  Inconsistent YANG Model Support

   Different vendors implement different YANG models (standard or
   proprietary), leading to:

   *  Lack of uniform data structures for configuration/state retrieval.

   *  Requirement for vendor-specific adaptations in automation scripts.

   Also IETF standard device models has slow adoption.  Similar device
   models are defined in Openconfig or other SDOs, therefore the current
   YANG device models ecosystem is fragmented.

3.2.  Partial or Non-Standard Network Management Protocols
      Implementations

   Some vendors only partially support standard Network management
   protocols, and proprietary extensions may break interoperability.
   Other vendors might choose non-stanard network management protocol or
   telemetry protocol such as gnmi [I-D.openconfig-rtgwg-gnmi-spec],
   grpc [I-D.kumar-rtgwg-grpc-protocol].  A significant number of
   network operators continue to rely on legacy network management
   mechanisms such as SNMP.

3.3.  YANG Models Lack Integration with Open APIs

   Today, open API has been widely adopted by the northbound interface
   of OSS/BSS or Network orchestrators while YANG data models have been
   widely adopted by the northbound interface of the network controller/
   orchestrator or the southbound interface of the network controller/
   orchestrator.  However Open API ecosystem and YANG model ecosystem
   are both built as silo and lack integration or mapping between them.

4.  Architecture Overview

   The LLM model with MCP support and its ability to comprehend diverse
   complex requirements and deliver corresponding functionalities, is
   well-suited for large scale multi-vendor network management
   environments, effectively addressing the aforementioned challenges in
   Section 3.  Therefore, we have introduced the MCP protocol in the
   network management environments for building an intelligent network
   management and control platform.

4.1.  Encapsulating Device Operations into MCP Tools

   *  Objective: Standardize device operations into modular, reusable
      tools.

   *  Implementation:

      -  Tool Abstraction: Vendor-specific commands are wrapped into
         discrete MCP Tools with uniform schemas.

      -  Tool Registry: A centralized database stores MCP Tools with
         metadata (e.g., names, descriptions, parameters).

   *  Benefits:

      -  Eliminates manual translation of commands across different
         vendors

      -  Enabling the plug-and-play integration of new device types.

4.2.  LLM for Intent-to-Tool-Request Translation

   *  Objective: Allow AI models (such as Claude) to understand natural
      language commands and trigger operations.

   *  Workflow:

      -  Intent Recognition: The LLM first analyzes the user's natural
         language query to identify：

         o  The user's intent or goal

         o  Required actions or operations

         o  Entities, parameters, and constraints mentioned

         o  Context from previous interactions

      -  Tool Discovery and Toolchain Generation: The LLM access tool
         descriptions provided by MCP servers, and matches the
         identified intent with available tools.

      -  Parameter Extraction and Mapping: The LLM maps natural language
         references to structured parameter names and extracts relevant
         information from the user query.

      -  Structured Invocation Generation: The LLM generates properly
         formatted tool calls following MCP's protocol.

   *  Benefits:

      -  Bridge natural language to tool invocation requests in a fixed
         format, then return this request to the client, enabling the
         client to properly parse the request.

4.3.  Closed-Loop Automation Execution Workflow

   *  Objective: Realize the closed loop of "voice/text commands →
      automatic execution".

   *  A general workflow is as follows:

      -  User Input Submission: An operator submits a natural language
         request to the MCP client.  And The MCP client forwards this
         request to the LLM.

      -  LLM Intent Processing: The LLM parses the input, identifies the
         operational intent, and forwards a structured request to the
         MCP client, which queries the MCP Server to retrieve the
         available tools.  The information would include the functional
         description, required parameters of tools.

      -  LLM Toolchain Decision:

         o  The LLM evaluates the context and if tools are required,
            select and sequence tools.

         o  The decision is sent back to the MCP Client and then MCP
            Client will execute tools via server.

      -  Tool Execution: The MCP Server executes the translated commands
         on target devices and returns results to the client.

      -  Result Aggregation & Feedback: The MCP Client collates tool
         outputs (success/failure logs) and forwards them to the LLM for
         summarization.

   *  Benefits:

      -  Tools safely retry/rollback.

      -  Full traceability of LLM decisions and tool executions.

4.4.  Example

   Take multi-vendor network management as an example, the MCP server is
   deployed locally on the network controller, and the tools are
   integrated into the MCP server.  The server provides the following
   registered tool descriptor information:

   Tools description: It describes the name, use, and parameters of
   tools.

   Tools implementation: MCP implementation describes how the tools are
   invoked.

   See Tool descriptor information example as follows:

# Tool Descriptor
[
  {
    "name": "batch_configure_devices",
    "description": "Batch Configure Network Devices"，
    "parameters": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "device_ips": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "Device IP List"}，
        "commands": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "CLI Sequence"}，
        "credential_id": {"type": "string", "description": "Credential ID"}
      }，
      "required": ["device_ips", "commands"]
    }
  },
  {
    "name": "check_device_status",
    "description": "Check the Status of Network Devices"，
    "parameters": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "device_ip": {"type": "string"},
        "metrics": {"type": "array", "items": {"enum": ["cpu", "memory", "interface"]}}
      }
    }
  }
]
# Tool Implementation
from netmiko import ConnectHandler
from mcp_server import McpServer

app = FastAPI()
server = McpServer(app)

#Connection Pool Management
devices = {
    "192.168.1.1": {"device_type": "VendorA-XYZ"，"credential": "admin:XYZ@password"},
    "192.168.1.2": {"device_type": "VendorB-ABC","credential":"admin:ABC@passowrd"}
     ....
}

@server.tool("batch_configure_devices")
async def batch_config(device_ips: list,commands: list,credential_id: str):
    results = {}
    for ip in device_ips:
        conn = ConnectHandler(
            ip = ip,
            username = devices[ip]["credential"].split(':')[0],
            password = devices[ip]["credential"].split(':')[1],
            device_type = devices[ip]["device_type"]
        )
        output = conn.send_config_set(commands)
        results[ip] = output
    return {"success": True, "details": results)

@server.tool("check_device_status")
async def check_status(device_ip: str, metrics: list):
    status = {}
    if "cpu" in metrics:
        status["cpu"] = get_cpu_usage (device_ip)
    if "memory" in metrics:
        status["memory"] = get_memory_usage(device_ip)
    return status

   Suppose a user submits a request (via the client) such as "Configure
   OSPF Area 0 with process ID 100 for all core switches in the Beijing
   data center," the MCP client retrieves the necessary tooling
   descriptor information from the MCP server and forwards it along with
   the request to the LLM.  The LLM determines the appropriate tools and
   responds in JSON format as follows:

   {
   "method": "batch_configure_devices",
   "params": {
      "device_ips":["192.168.10.1",....,"192.168.10.10"],
      "command": [
        "router ospf 100",
        "network 192.168.0.0 0.0.255.255 area 0"
      ]
    }
   }
   }

   The MCP server executes the network management operation in JSON
   format and returns the results to the MCP client, which forwards them
   to the LLM.  The LLM parses the response, generates a natural-
   language summary, and sends it back to the client for final
   presentation to the user.  See natural lanauge summary example as
   follows:

   {
     "192.168.10.1": "Configure Successfully, take 2.3 seconds",
     "192.168.10.2": "Error: no response from the device",
   }

5.  Deployment Considerations

   This section describes MCP deployment requirements for network
   management environments, followed by implementation scenarios.  Key
   architectural requirements include:

   *  Function-Specific MCP Servers: To maintain proper architecture and
      performance with growing tool volumes, servers should be
      categorized by network management function.  Typical categories
      include network log analysis, device configuration management,
      energy consumption management, and security operations.

   *  Secure and Scalable Architecture: The architecture must:

      -  Enforce strict access controls limiting MCP operations to
         authorized AI models and users

      -  Scale efficiently with increasing network device counts while
         maintaining performance

   *  Automated Workflows: MCP implementations should support LLM-
      coordinated automation of:

      -  Real-time monitoring and diagnostics

      -  Fault remediation workflows

      -  Other common management operations to reduce operator workload

   While these core requirements apply universally, operational
   characteristics vary based on deployment location (on-premises vs.
   remote).  The following subsections detail these deployment
   scenarios.

   In this senario, the MCP server is deployed within the network
   controller, which could potentially be a cloud environment.  The MCP
   server acts as a protocol converter, transforming NETCONF's XML/YANG
   models into JSON-RPC 2.0 format for AI system. - Scope: The MCP
   Server, colocated with the MCP Client and LLM model, is hosted within
   a cloud environment, the network devices stay as it is. - Key
   Characteristics: - Centralized Management: A single MCP Client
   instance can manage all network devices in geographically dispersed
   network.  - Scalability: Cloud-native scaling accommodates dynamic
   tool registry updates and high request volumes.

6.1.  MCP Hosted Within the Network Controller

   *  Pro

      -  Resource utilization efficiency: Controllers usually have
         stronger computing and storage resources, which can better
         support the operation of MCP Server and will not have a
         significant impact on the performance of the network equipment
         itself.

      -  Security:

         o  Security mechanisms can be implemented centrally on the
            controller, and the overall security can be improved through
            unified authentication, authorization and audit mechanisms.

         o  Reduces the risk of equipment being exposed to the network
            and reduces the possibility of being attacked.

      -  Protocol adaptability:

         o  Communicating with devices through the NETCONF protocol can
            better be compatible with existing devices and protocols,
            reducing the need for equipment modification.

         o  NETCONF protocol has wide support and mature tool chains in
            the industry, which is easy to develop and maintain.

   *  Con

      -  Latency and real-time performance:

         o  Since management instructions need to be forwarded through
            the controller, latency may increase and real-time
            performance may be affected.

         o  For some scenarios with extremely high real-time
            requirements, it may not meet the requirements.

      -  Protocol conversion complexity:

         o  The MCP protocol needs to be converted to the NETCONF
            protocol, which increases the complexity and development
            cost of protocol conversion.

         o  It is necessary to deal with compatibility and consistency
            issues between different protocols.

6.2.  MCP Server Hosted within the Network Device

   *  Pro

      -  The protocol stack simplification:

         o  If you deploy the MCP Server directly on the network device,
            you can skip the NETCONF protocol layer and manage the
            device directly through MCP.  This reduces the complexity of
            protocol conversion and simplifies the overall architecture.

         o  It reduces the development and maintenance costs caused by
            protocol adaptation, especially when the device manufacturer
            supports the MCP protocol.

      -  Real-time performance and response speed:

         o  The MCP Server is directly deployed on the device, which
            reduces the transmission latency in the middle and can
            respond to management instructions faster, which is suitable
            for scenarios with high real-time requirements.

   *  Con

      -  Device Resource Consumption:

         o  Network devices usually have limited resources (CPU, memory,
            etc.).  Deploying MCP Server may occupy a large amount of
            resources, affecting the normal operation of the device.

         o  It is necessary to optimize and expand the hardware and
            software resources of the device, which increases the
            complexity of the device.

      -  Security and Management Complexity:

         o  Each device needs to manage the security of the MCP server
            separately (such as authentication, authorization, audit,
            etc.), which increases the complexity of management.

         o  Each device needs to independently deploy and maintain the
            MCP Server, which increases the operation and maintenance
            cost.

      -  Incompatible with Legacy devices:

         o  Legacy devices do not have the ability to support MCP
            servers and still need NETCONF to implement network
            configuration.  This makes it impossible for the network to
            form a unified control mechanism.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.

8.  Security Considerations

   The MCP protocol needs to consider scenarios where either the client
   or server encounters issues, such as crashes.  If one or both parties
   go offline during communication, the entire process may remain stuck
   waiting for messages, potentially leading to an infinite loop.
   Furthermore, certain tool operations may be interrupted, and some
   irreversible network management operations could be affected.

   Due to network latency, some operations might not return in time, yet
   from the user's perspective, these operations may appear either
   unexecuted or failed.  If the user then initiates another tool
   request to the server, problems may occur.

   For complex network management workflows, while LLM's tool invocation
   process may generally function correctly, issues can arise in the
   details.  Users must verify each LLM operation to prevent unintended
   hazardous actions.
