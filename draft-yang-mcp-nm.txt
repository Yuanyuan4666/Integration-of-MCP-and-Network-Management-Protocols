1.  Introduction

   The Model Control Protocol (MCP) provides a standardized way for LLMs
   to access and utilize information from different sources, making it
   easier to build AI applications that can interact with external
   systems.

   MCP has been seen as rapid adoption technology in the consumer field.
   The application of MCP in the network management field is meant to
   develop various rich AI driven network applications, realize intent
   based networks management automation in the multi-vendor
   heterogeneous network environment.  By establishing standard
   interfaces for tool encapsulation, intent translation, and closed-
   loop execution, MCP enables:

   *  Unified operation abstraction through normalized MCP tool
      definitions

   *  Seamless LLM integration via structured API contracts

   *  Closed-Loop Automation Execution

   This document outlines the applicability of MCP to the network
   management in the IP network that utilizes IETF technologies.  It
   explores operational aspect, key components, generic workflow and
   deployment senarios.  The impact of integrating MCP into the network
   management system is also discussed.

2.  Terminology & Notation Conventions

   The following terms are used throughout this document:

2.1.  MCP

   *  *Host*: The entity initiating the LLM request

   *  *Client*: A built-in module within a host, specifically designed
      for interaction with the MCP server.

   *  *CLI*: Command Line Interface

   *  *MCP Server*: A dedicated server that interacts with MCP clients
      and provides MCP services.

   *  *MCP protocol*: The whole MCP framework

2.2.  Others

   *  *LLM*: Large Language Model

   *  *Netconf*: Network Configuration Protocol

   *  *Restconf*: RESTful Network Configuration Protocol

3.  Overveiw of key challenges for the network management

   In large scale network management environment, a large number of
   devices from different vendors need to be uniformly managed, which
   can lead to the following issues:

3.1.  Inconsistent YANG Model Support

   Different vendors implement different YANG models (standard or
   proprietary), leading to:

   *  Lack of uniform data structures for configuration/retrieval.

   *  Requirement for vendor-specific adaptations in automation scripts.

3.2.  Partial or Non-Standard RESTCONF/NETCONF Implementations

   Some vendors only partially support standard YANG models, and
   proprietary extensions may break interoperability.

3.3.  Performance & Scalability Issues

   NETCONF defined in [RFC6241], while transactional and robust, can be
   more resource-intensive, particularly for large deployments and fast-
   changing configurations.

   RESTCONF defined in [RFC8040], with its stateless, web-friendly
   architecture, scales better but may lack the advanced transactional
   features of NETCONF and can be less efficient for bandwidth-intensive
   operations.

4.  Operational Consideration

   This section outlines operational aspects of MCP with Network
   management requirements as follows:

   *  _Function-Specific MCP Servers_: Deploy dedicated MCP servers
      tailored to different functions and domains, such as network log
      analysis, device configuration management, energy consumption
      management, and security operations.

   *  _Secure and Scalable Architecture_: Implement stringent security
      measures to ensure only authorized AI models and users can access
      and control network resources via MCP.

   *  _Automated Workflows_: Leverage MCP to enable LLM-coordinated
      multi-tool automation, supporting real-time monitoring,
      diagnostics, and fault remediation.

5.  Architecture Overview

   The LLM model with MCP support, with its ability to comprehend
   diverse complex requirements and deliver corresponding
   functionalities, is well- suited for large scale multi-vendor network
   management environments, effectively addressing the aforementioned
   operational challenges in section Section 4.  Therefore, we have
   introduced the MCP protocol in the network management environments
   for building an intelligent network management and control platform.

5.1.  Encapsulating Device Operations into MCP Tools

   *  _Objective_: Standardize heterogeneous device operations into
      modular, reusable tools.

   *  _Implementation_:

      -  _Tool Abstraction_: Vendor-specific commands are wrapped into
         discrete MCP Tools with uniform schemas.

      -  _Tool Registry_: A centralized repository hosts MCP Tools with
         metadata (e.g., vendor compatibility, privilege requirements).

      -  _Dynamic Loading_: MCP Servers dynamically invoke required
         tools via NETCONF on demand, thereby decoupling tool lifecycle
         management from the server's core functionality.

   *  _Benefits_:

      -  Eliminates manual translation of commands across vendors.

      -  Enables plug-and-play integration of new device types.

5.2.  LLM APIs for Intent-to-Tool Translation

   *  Objective: Bridge natural language instructions to executable tool
      sequences.

   *  Workflow:

      -  Command Parsing: LLM APIs (e.g., GPT-4, Claude) process user
         queries like "Upgrade all switches in Datacenter A during
         maintenance" into structured commands.

      -  Toolchain Generation: The LLM selects and sequences MCP Tools
         (e.g., get_inventory → schedule_downtime → download_firmware →
         validate_upgrade).

      -  Validation: Pre-execution checks verify tool compatibility with
         target devices.

   *  APIs Exposed:

      -  mcp-translate: Converts intent to toolchain JSON.

      -  mcp-validate: Confirms tool availability/permissions.

5.3.  Closed-Loop Automation Execution

   *  Objective: Achieve end-to-end automation from language input to
      network changes.

   *  Execution Flow:

      -  User Input: Operator submits request via chat/voice (e.g.,
         "Block TCP port 22 on all edge routers").

      -  LLM Processing:

         o  Intent → Toolchain: Identifies get_edge_routers +
            configure_acl tools.

         o  Parameter Binding: Maps "TCP port 22" to {"protocol": "tcp",
            "port": 22, "action": "deny"}.

      -  Orchestration: MCP Runtime schedules tools, handles
         dependencies (e.g., backup configs first), and enforces RBAC.

      -  Feedback: Real-time logs/rollback if configure_acl fails on any
         device.

   *  Key Features:

      -  Idempotency: Tools safely retry/rollback.

      -  Auditability: Full traceability of LLM decisions and tool
         executions.

5.4.  Workflow

   A general workflow is as follows:

   *  User Input Submission: An operator submits a natural language
      request (e.g., "Disable port 22 on all edge switches") to the LLM
      interface.

   *  LLM Intent Processing: The LLM parses the input, identifies the
      operational intent, and forwards a structured request to the local
      O&M Console for validation and logging.

   *  MCP Tool Discovery: The O&M Console routes the request to the MCP
      Client, which queries the MCP Server to retrieve the available
      tools.

   *  LLM Toolchain Decision:

      -  The LLM evaluates the context and if tools are required, select
         and sequence tools.

      -  The decision is sent back to the MCP Client and then MCP Client
         will execute tools via server.

   *  Protocol Translation & Execution: The MCP Server executes the
      translated commands on target devices and returns results to the
      client.

   *  Result Aggregation & Feedback: The MCP Client collates tool
      outputs (success/failure logs) and forwards them to the LLM for
      summarization.

   While the overall workflow remains consistent, the MCP Server's
   deployment location (on-premises or remote) introduces operational
   variations.  This section defines two refined approaches to
   accommodate differing deployment scenarios.

5.5.  Deployment considerations

   While the overall workflow remains consistent, the MCP Server's
   deployment location (on-premises or remote) introduces operational
   variations.  This section explores two deployment considerations.
