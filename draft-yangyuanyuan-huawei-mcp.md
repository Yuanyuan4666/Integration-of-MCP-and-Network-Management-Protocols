--- abstract

In today's complex network environment, the unified management of multi-vendor network devices faces numerous challenges, such as diverse models and complex configurations. Traditional network management protocols like Netconf and Restconf are difficult to standardize during the management process, resulting in low efficiency. MCP (Model Context Protocol) technology, combined with LLM technology, brings new ideas and solutions for the batch management of multi-vendor network devices, and is expected to significantly improve the efficiency and flexibility of network management.
