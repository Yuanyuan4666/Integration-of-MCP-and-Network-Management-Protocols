1.  Introduction

   The Model Context Protocol (MCP) decouples LLMs from tools and
   provides a standardized way for LLMs to access and utilize
   information from different data sources and tools, making it easier
   to build AI applications that can interact with external LLM models
   and software tools and enable workflows automation.

   MCP has seen rapid adoption across both startups and enterprises
   since it announced in November 2024.  Key use cases include AI coding
   assistants in IDEs, data analysis tools that can query databases, and
   productivity tools that can interact with services like Slack or
   Google Drive.

   The application of MCP for the network management is meant to
   refactor network management operation and network capabilities as
   tools and provide more agile and extensible architecture to expose or
   consume these AI integration capabilities.

   With integration of MCP into the network management system, it allow
   you develop various rich AI driven network applications, realize
   intent based networks management, automate workflows in the multi-
   vendor heterogeneous network platform.  By establishing standard
   interfaces for tool encapsulation, intent translation, and closed-
   loop execution within the network management system, MCP enables the
   network management system to have:

   *  Unified operation abstraction through normalized MCP tool
      definitions

   *  Seamless LLM integration via the structured protocol

   *  Automation Execution Ability

   This document discusses the applicability of MCP to the network
   management plane in the IP network that utilizes IETF technologies.
   It explores MCP for network exposure, multiple MCP server discovery
   generic workflow and deployment scenarios.

   There are 3 values for MCP coupling with the network management

   *  Network MCP Server support

      -  Exposing network capabilities as MCP Servers for 3rd-party AI
         Agents & applications

   *  In Network Service

      -  Empowering network services by leveraging MCP ecosystem tools &
         contents

      -  Network service as a unified interface to various and rich
         capabilities for network users

   *  Network Management Intelligence

      -  Making network architecture really agile and friendly for
         innovation

      -  Decoupling network management functions into network agents and
         network tools

4.  The high level Challenges in adopting MCP in NM

   *  Protocol Design

      -  Error Handling o Although MCP provides basic error codes, MCP
         does not yet enforce a entire error-handling mechanism, and its
         scope is currently limited to discovery and invocation,
         omitting crucial aspects like tool governance, versioning, or
         lifecycle management.

      -  Stateful o The protocol's reliance on stateful Server-Sent
         Events (SSE) can create significant complexities when
         integrating with inherently stateless REST APIs, requiring
         developers to manage state externally.  This can be
         particularly challenging for remote MCP servers due to network
         latency and instability, complicating load balancing and
         horizontal scaling efforts.

      -  Context Handling o There are also concerns that multiple active
         MCP connections could consume significant tokens in the LLM's
         context window.  This can directly impact an LLM's performance,
         slowing down responses and potentially hindering its ability to
         maintain focus and reason effectively over extended or complex
         interactions.

   *  Security Consideration

      -  Malicious Actors The protocol's ability to grant LLMs access to
         external systems introduces potential vulnerabilities that
         require careful consideration o Prompt injection, where
         malicious instructions embedded in user inputs or tool
         descriptions could lead to unintended actions by the LLM o Tool
         poisoning, where attackers modify tool definitions, or rug
         pulls (similar to tool poisoning but occurs post-installation)
         o Tool shadowing, where a malicious server creates a tool with
         the same name as a legitimate tool from another server to
         intercept calls

      -  Security enforcement o MCP itself lacks inherent security
         enforcement mechanisms, relying heavily on external
         implementations for authentication and authorization, which
         were not initially well-defined within the protocol.

      -  Identity Management o Determining clear identity management -
         whether requests originate from the end user, the AI agent, or
         a shared system account - remains an area needing clearer
         definition.

5.  MCP for Network Exposure

   Network exposure is the process of making network capabilities, such
   as data and connectivity services, available to external users,
   applications, and developers through secure APIs.  It allows for more
   agility and the creation of programmable networks.  The MCP can be
   used to expose network capabilities to AI applications or consume
   external sources for LLMs.

   Step 1: External tools or data source publish a set of APIs to MCP
   server in the Network Controller.  Step 2: MCP client send specific
   tools request to discover tools and MCP Server provide authorization
   to the MCP client.  Step 3: After sucessful authorization, MCP server
   return API list corresponding to tools request sent by the MCP
   client.  Step 4: MCP Client invokes tools with authorization.

   Step 0: MCP Client is preconfigured with the MCP Server address.
   Step 1: IETF Network Management AI Agent sends a MCP Service Request
   to the MCP client within the Network Controller.  Step 2: The MCP
   client discover tools provided by the external MCP server.  Step 3:
   The MCP client provide available tools list to the IETF Network
   Management AI Agent.

6.  MCP Server Discovery

   The MCP Server Discovery involves clients querying servers to find
   available tools, resources, and functions.  In case of MCP servers
   are distributed in different locations, MCP Respository can be
   established to keep track of the location of each MCP servers.

   Step 0: The MCP Server syncs up on the info of tools, upon tools is
   added or removed, tools changes will be automatically syned up with
   the MCP server.  Step 1: Each new MCP server will register to the
   centralized MCP registry.  Step 2.1: MCP Client send the MCP service
   request to the MCP registry for specific capability.  Step 2.2: The
   MCP registry return specific MCP server to the MCP client.  Step 3:
   The MCP Client request authorization from the MCP server.  Step 4:
   The MCP Client invoke specific tools with authorization.

7.  Deployment Consideration in adopting MCP in the Network Management

   This section describes MCP deployment requirements for network
   management environments, followed by implementation scenarios.  Key
   architectural requirements include:

   *  Function-Specific MCP Servers: To maintain proper architecture and
      performance with growing tool volumes, servers should be
      categorized by network management functions.  Typical categories
      include network log analysis, device configuration management,
      energy consumption management, and security operations, etc.

   *  Secure and Scalable Architecture: The architecture must:

      -  Enforce strict access controls limiting MCP operations to
         authorized AI models and users

      -  Scale efficiently with increasing number of network devices
         while maintaining performance

   *  Automated Workflows: MCP implementations should support LLM-
      coordinated automation of:

      -  Real-time monitoring and diagnostics

      -  Fault remediation workflows

      -  Other common management operations to reduce operator workload

   While these core requirements apply universally, operational
   characteristics vary based on deployment location.  The following
   subsections detail these deployment scenarios.

7.1.  Network Element Inter-Communication using MCP

   In this network scenario, the MCP client is deployed in one smart
   network element while the MCP server is deployed in another smart
   network element.  The MCP client communicates with the MCP server
   using the MCP protocol and invoke specific tools and get access to
   specific data in the network element as a data source.  In addition,
   human operator can use nature language to interact with smart network
   element to investigate protocol troubleshooting information.

   Network element usually have limited resources (CPU, memory, etc.).
   Deploying MCP Client together with SLM may occupy a large amount of
   resources, affecting the normal operation of the device.

7.2.  Network Controller consumes API or Data source using MCP

   In this network scenario, the MCP client is deployed in the network
   controller while the MCP server is deployed in either the 3rd party
   managment system or external data source.  The MCP client
   communicates with the MCP server using the MCP protocol and invoke
   specific tools and get access to specific data in the 3rd party
   management system or external data source.

   |                        |     |            |
   +------------------------+     +------------+

7.3.  Standalone MCP server to Expose APIs and tools to the Network
      Controller

   In this network scenario, The MCP client is deployed in the network
   controller while the MCP server is deployed standalone to manage all
   the network elements.  The network elements will be refactored as
   data source or tools so that MCP client can directly consume these
   APIs or data sources.  Alternatively, the network elements can be
   traditional network elements.  MCP server will serve as protocol
   adaptor to translate MCP protocol into traditional network management
   protocols such as NETCONF, gNMI.

7.4.  The Network Gateway/Controller and the Network Element
      Communication using MCP

   In this network scenario, The MCP client is deployed in the network
   gateway device while the MCP server is deployed in each network
   devices.  The MCP client communicates with the MCP server using the
   MCP protocol.  LLM model is pre-trained model and deployed in the
   same Network gateway as the MCP client.

   Network devices usually have limited resources (CPU, memory, etc.).
   Deploying MCP Server may occupy a large amount of resources,
   affecting the normal operation of the device.

8.  MCP architecture Design for Network Management

8.1.  Encapsulating Device Operations into MCP Tools

   *  Objective: Standardize device operations into modular, reusable
      tools.

   *  Implementation:

      -  Tool Abstraction: Vendor-specific commands are wrapped into
         discrete MCP Tools with uniform schemas.

      -  Tool Registry: A centralized database stores MCP Tools with
         metadata (e.g., names, descriptions, parameters).

   *  Benefits:

      -  Eliminates manual translation of commands across different
         vendors

      -  Enabling the plug-and-play integration of new device types.

8.2.  LLM for Intent-to-Tool-Request Translation

   *  Objective: Allow AI models (such as Claude) to understand natural
      language commands and trigger operations.

   *  Workflow:

      -  Intent Recognition: The LLM first analyzes the user's natural
         language query to identify：

         o  The user's intent or goal

         o  Required actions or operations

         o  Entities, parameters, and constraints mentioned

         o  Context from previous interactions

      -  Tool Discovery and Toolchain Generation: The LLM access tool
         descriptions provided by MCP servers, and matches the
         identified intent with available tools.

      -  Parameter Extraction and Mapping: The LLM maps natural language
         references to structured parameter names and extracts relevant
         information from the user query.

      -  Structured Invocation Generation: The LLM generates properly
         formatted tool calls following MCP's protocol.

   *  Benefits:

      -  Bridge natural language to tool invocation requests in a fixed
         format, then return this request to the client, enabling the
         client to properly parse the request.

8.3.  Closed-Loop Automation Execution Workflow

   *  Objective: Realize the closed loop of "voice/text commands →
      automatic execution".

   *  A general workflow is as follows:

      -  User Input Submission: An operator submits a natural language
         request to the MCP client.  And The MCP client forwards this
         request to the LLM.

      -  LLM Intent Processing: The LLM parses the input, identifies the
         operational intent, and forwards a structured request to the
         MCP client, which queries the MCP Server to retrieve the
         available tools.  The information would include the functional
         description, required parameters of tools.

      -  LLM Toolchain Decision:

         o  The LLM evaluates the context and if tools are required,
            select and sequence tools.

         o  The decision is sent back to the MCP Client and then MCP
            Client will execute tools via server.

      -  Tool Execution: The MCP Server executes the translated commands
         on target devices and returns results to the client.

      -  Result Aggregation & Feedback: The MCP Client collates tool
         outputs (success/failure logs) and forwards them to the LLM for
         summarization.

   *  Benefits:

      -  Tools safely retry/rollback.

      -  Full traceability of LLM decisions and tool executions.

9.  Interworking with the Network Management protocol and YANG data
    models

   MCP can be seen as AI protocol and used to invoke AI integrated
   capabilities.  MCP is not in the position to replace the network
   management and YANG data model.  Instead, it can be integrated
   together, e.g., * Integrated MCP with CLI, allow the MCP client
   invoke CLI capabilities; * Integrated MCP with YANG, allow the MCP
   client invoke YANG interface related capabilities;

10.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.

11.  Security Considerations

   The MCP protocol needs to consider scenarios where either the client
   or server encounters issues, such as crashes.  If one or both parties
   go offline during communication, the entire process may remain stuck
   waiting for messages, potentially leading to an infinite loop.
   Furthermore, certain tool operations may be interrupted, and some
   irreversible network management operations could be affected.

   Due to network latency, some operations might not return in time, yet
   from the user's perspective, these operations may appear either
   unexecuted or failed.  If the user then initiates another tool
   request to the server, problems may occur.

   For complex network management workflows, while LLM's tool invocation
   process may generally function correctly, issues can arise in the
   details.  Users must verify each LLM operation to prevent unintended
   hazardous actions.

Appendix A.  MCP Usage Examples

A.1.  Device Configuration using MCP+CLI

   In this example, The network element implement the MCP Server and
   exposes all CLI interfaces and documentation as tools to the MCP
   Client.  The Nework controller implements the MCP client and interact
   with MCP server in the Network element.

   The MCP server provides the following registered tool descriptor
   information:

   Tools description: It describes the name, use, and parameters of
   tools.

   Tools implementation: MCP implementation describes how the tools are
   invoked.

   See Tool descriptor information example as follows:

# Tool Descriptor
[
  {
    "name": "batch_configure_devices",
    "description": "Batch Configure Network Devices"，
    "parameters": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "device_ips": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "Device IP List"}，
        "commands": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "CLI Sequence"}，
        "credential_id": {"type": "string", "description": "Credential ID"}
      }，
      "required": ["device_ips", "commands"]
    }
  },
  {
    "name": "check_device_status",
    "description": "Check the Status of Network Devices"，
    "parameters": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "device_ip": {"type": "string"},
        "metrics": {"type": "array", "items": {"enum": ["cpu", "memory", "interface"]}}
      }
    }
  }
]
# Tool Implementation
from netmiko import ConnectHandler
from mcp_server import McpServer

app = FastAPI()
server = McpServer(app)

#Connection Pool Management
devices = {
    "192.168.1.1": {"device_type": "VendorA-XYZ"，"credential": "admin:XYZ@password"},
    "192.168.1.2": {"device_type": "VendorB-ABC","credential":"admin:ABC@passowrd"}
     ....
}

@server.tool("batch_configure_devices")
async def batch_config(device_ips: list,commands: list,credential_id: str):
    results = {}
    for ip in device_ips:
        conn = ConnectHandler(
            ip = ip,
            username = devices[ip]["credential"].split(':')[0],
            password = devices[ip]["credential"].split(':')[1],
            device_type = devices[ip]["device_type"]
        )
        output = conn.send_config_set(commands)
        results[ip] = output
    return {"success": True, "details": results)

@server.tool("check_device_status")
async def check_status(device_ip: str, metrics: list):
    status = {}
    if "cpu" in metrics:
        status["cpu"] = get_cpu_usage (device_ip)
    if "memory" in metrics:
        status["memory"] = get_memory_usage(device_ip)
    return status

   Suppose a user submits a request (via the client) such as "Configure
   OSPF Area 0 with process ID 100 for all core switches in the Beijing
   data center," the MCP client retrieves the necessary tooling
   descriptor information from the MCP server and forwards it along with
   the request to the LLM.  The LLM determines the appropriate tools and
   responds in JSON format as follows:

   {
   "method": "batch_configure_devices",
   "params": {
      "device_ips":["192.168.10.1",....,"192.168.10.10"],
      "command": [
        "router ospf 100",
        "network 192.168.0.0 0.0.255.255 area 0"
      ]
    }
   }
   }

   The MCP server responds to the call instruction, converts it into the
   below CLIs of different vendors, and then the devices execute the
   CLIs.  The results are returned to the MCP client in Json as below
   and are forwarded to the LLM.  The LLM parses the response, generates
   a natural-language summary, and sends it back to the client for final
   presentation to the user.

# Convert to CLI commands of different vendors
"commands": [
    "system-view",
    "ospf {{process_id}}",
    "area {{area_id}}",
    "network {{network_address}} {{wildcard_mask}}"
  ]

"commands": [
    "configure terminal",
    "router ospf {{process_id}}",
    "network {{network_address}} {{wildcard_mask}} area {{area_id}}",
    "end",
    "write memory"
  ]

#Feedbacks received by the MCP client of different vendors
{
    "status": "success",
    "message": "OSPF configuration applied successfully on device 192.168.10.1",
    "commands_executed": [
        "system-view",
        "ospf 100",
        "area 0.0.0.0",
        "network 192.168.10.0 0.0.0.255"
    ]
}

{
    "status": "success",
    "message": "OSPF configuration applied successfully on device 192.168.10.1",
    "commands_executed": [
        "configure terminal",
        "router ospf 100",
        "network 192.168.10.0 0.0.0.255 area 0",
        "end",
        "write memory"
    ]
}

# Natural lanauge summary of success or failure:
{
  "192.168.10.1": "Configure Successfully, take 2.3 seconds",
  "192.168.10.2": "Error: no response from the device",
}
